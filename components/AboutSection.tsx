              Hey, whats up! my name is Yash and I am a{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">{" funny (self-proclaimed)"}</span>,

              based in Iselin, NJ.

            <br />
            <p>
              I am currenty a sophomore at Rutgers University stuyding CS and Economics.
              I am interested in pursuing a career in in full stack software development and
              am open to any opportunties the field!
              </p>
              <br />
            <p>
              I speak fluent Java, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript (as well as secondary languages like English, Hindi and Gujarati).
              I'm also convinced that debugging is just detective work with some more steps. My laptop is my partner-in-crime,
              we're on a quest to save the world from endless runtime errors and missing ;'s.
              <br />
              <br />
              Economics, for me, is like a never-ending puzzle that is always evolving. I love diving into the technical trends of consumer and
              producer decision making, data that is like modern art to me, and debates about fiscal policy that can put a heated game of Monopoly
              to shame.
              <br />
              <br />
              When I finally step away from the pixels and price elasticity, you'll find me hiking the trails,
              channeling my inner coffee connoisseur in local caf√©s, or attempting to live out my NBA dreams
              at the park. 
            </p>
